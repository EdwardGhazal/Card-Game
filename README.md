As a team of three, we brought a classic card game to life at the hardware level by building a two-player game entirely in MIPS assembly for a Computer Architecture course. Each round, both players choose a card while a custom random number generator maps the draw to a value between 1 and 8 across all four suits. The game engine evaluates the cards in real time, determines the winner, and awards points accordingly, or to both players in the case of a tie. A dynamic scoreboard continuously updates and displays the scores, showcasing precise control over low-level logic, state management, and real-time interaction in a constrained programming environment.
